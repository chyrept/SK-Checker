# SK-Checker
🔑 SK CHECKER [PY] 🔑

Check SK Keys with Stripe API easily with no proxy and multi threaded. The checker supports multiple keys (one per line on a text file).

⚙️ You need following modules : 

py -m pip install requests colorama 

Make a TXT file and paste all keys in it, after that save and close it. Now you run thLive-Keys.txte tool by following :

👉 python3 sk-checker.py list.txt

While list.txt is your list with keys.

✅ The valid / live keys are saved at Live-Keys.txt.

❌ Invalid keys are not saved and negative values of amount usage written to N-Live-Keys.txt.

0️⃣ Zero balance will be written to Z-Live-Keys.txt.

Further development will be added, if people gives me a valid, chargeable key, and a valid cc.
